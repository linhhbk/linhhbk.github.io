## DRL for Resource Management in Mobile Edge Computing
[![Open on IEEE Xplore](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-View_on_IEEE_Xplore-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102429) [![Open on IEEE Xplore](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Preprint_on_TechRxiv-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](/files/TechRxiv-ToN-DualConnectivity.pdf)
<p style='width:700px'>We developed a deep reinforcement learning framework to balance computational workloads between a terrestrial base station (the Master eNodeB) and a drone base station (the Second eNodeB) for a dynamic edge computing system with dual connectivity. The proposed framework is with guaranteed convergence and near-optimal performance. The research outcomes were published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking in April 2023.</p>

## SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction 
[![Open Project Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Project_Report-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](/files/ds-capstone-project-report.pdf) [![View on Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/linhhoang-ex/SpaceX-Falcon9)

<p style='width:700px'>A record of each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space was collected via web scraping and SpaceX API. Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis were performed on the collected data using SQL queries and Pandas. Several machine learning models (SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression) were built to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.</p>
