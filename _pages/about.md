I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Japan. I am a member of the <ins>[Computer Communications Laboratory](http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/labs/ce-cc/)</ins> under the supervision of Professor <ins>[Anh T. PHAM](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~pham/)</ins>. 

My interests include statistics, data analysis, and data-driven forecasting. I am passionate and curious about finding insights from large-scale data and developing data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
