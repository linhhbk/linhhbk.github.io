<br>
I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Japan. I am a member of the [Computer Communications Laboratory](http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/labs/ce-cc/) under the supervision of Professor [Anh T. PHAM](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~pham/). 

My Ph.D. research, titled _"Learning-based Resource Management in UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks,"_ studies a new approach integrating machine learning techniques (deep learning and model-free reinforcement learning) into resource management of UAV-assisted wireless networks. The two focuses are on optimizing network resource allocation and adaptive deployment of aerial base stations to enable edge computing in 5G and beyond networks.

<!-- My interests include statistics, data analysis, and data-driven forecasting. I am passionate and curious about finding insights from large-scale data and developing data-driven solutions to business problems.  -->
