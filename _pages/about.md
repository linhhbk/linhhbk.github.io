I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Japan. I am a member of the [Computer Communications Laboratory](http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/labs/ce-cc/) under the supervision of Professor [Anh T. PHAM](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~pham/). 

My Ph.D. research, titled _"Learning-based Resource Management in UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks,"_ studies a new approach integrating machine learning techniques (deep learning and model-free reinforcement learning) into resource management of UAV-assisted wireless networks. The two focuses are on optimizing network resource allocation and adaptive deployment of aerial base stations to enable edge computing in 5G and beyond networks.

My interests include statistics, data analysis, and data-driven forecasting. I am passionate and curious about finding insights from large-scale data and developing data-driven solutions to real-time problems.
